h1. MySystem

Part of the CLEAR project, MySystem is a system diagraming tool. Part of the goal is to be a light-weight javascript
component to be used inside something like mozSwing (?)

See the basecamp docs for the project description for "CLEAR":http://concordconsortium.basecamphq.com/projects/2939067/project/log
See Alex' Narratives in "this spreadsheet":http://concordconsortium.basecamphq.com/projects/2939067/file/30061007/CLEAR%20Narrative%20Linking%205_28.xls


h2. Dependencies

Based on "WireIt":http://http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit/
Which uses "YUI":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/

(note: that currently all dependent libraries are included in this repo, and thats not good....)
(note: We are working on reducing dependancies on these libraries.)

h2. Developer notes:

h3. Building:

If you need to make a compact and easy to distribute version of MySystem, you can use Rake
to build a dist/ directory.  *Building is not required* You can preview the work simply by opening
./mysystem-dev.html in your browser.

If you have ruby installed, you should also install a few gems to run the distro rake task
* @sudo gem install --remote sprockets@
* @sudo gem sources -a http://gems.opscode.com@
* @rake@
* @open ./dist/mysystem.html@*

h3. Testing

first install visionmedia-jspec with @sudo gem install visionmedia-jspec@
We are trying to get better about testing javascript. All test can be run from ./test/spec.dev.html.

After you have built
